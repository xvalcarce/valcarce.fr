      <title>Quantum bound on the CHSH inequality: NPA in Julia with NCTSSOS</title>

      <description>The CHSH inequality is used to grasp the non-local nature of bipartite games in which each party perform one out of two dichotomic measurements on a shared state. The Tsilerson bound of the CHSH inequality is the maximum violation of this inequality under the best quantum strategy [1]. I.e. the highest CHSH score that can be obtained over all quantum states and measurements.
Finding the best CHSH score can be seen as an optimization of a polynomial of non-commutative variables.</description>

      <title>Python - LP/SDP for Quantum Information with PICOS</title>

      <description>SDP interface and Solver PICOS is the Python interface I recommend to write/solve LP/SDP problem. It is under the GPLv3 free-license, probably supports your favorite solver, has crucial features for quantum information and, most importantly, has an attentive and friendly developer community.
Regarding SDP solvers, I had best performance with MOSEK. Sadly, this solver is proprietary (if price is of your concern, MOSEK offers a free one-year license for students). CVXOPT is a relatively good free-licensed alternative to MOSEK.</description>

      <description>To avoid your ISP eavesdropping on website you visit and other url you try to resolv, using privacy friendly DNS server is a necessity.
dnscrypt-proxy supports the encryption of your DNS request over HTTPS, and makes use of the DNSCrypt protocol. Here is a small guide to set this up alongside NetworkManager.
Installation Install the dnscrypt package provided by your distribution:
+ dnscrypt-proxy for ArchLinux
+ dnscrypt-proxy for Debian-based distribution</description>

      <title>Julia - One-Time Pad (XOR)</title>

      <description>Disclaimer This is a pet project to help me understand the relatively new programming language Julia. I don‚Äôt guarantee that the code in this blog post is optimal, nor respect all Julia conventions.
Algorithm objective An implementation of the one-time pad encryption algorithm, based on the XOR gate. The code should be able to encrypt any given file by generating a key of this file‚Äôs size and XORing the file with the key, bit-by-bit.</description>
